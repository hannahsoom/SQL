# To complete this project, I downloaded the Spotify data from Kaggle, created a table to insert the data into and performed an analysis on it using SQL.

# Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I analyzed the data using the following queries.

# Who are the top ten artists, based on popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# How many songs does Olivia Rodrigo have in the top 50 list?
SELECT COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

# How many songs on the top 50 list have a danceability rating of at least 0.75?
SELECT COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability >= 0.75;

# What is the average popularity percentage of all songs with an energy and danceabilty rating of at least 0.75?
SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy >= 0.75
AND danceability >= 0.75;
